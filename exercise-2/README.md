# Exercise 2: Handle dynamic data using slots

The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with passing components as children to other components.

We'll do this by creating a layout component called `odyssey-frame` whose purpose is to wrap it's child content with a cool border style

## Steps

1. Create the correct markup for `odyssey-frame`
2. Wrap an instance of `odyssey-frame` around your `album-art` component
